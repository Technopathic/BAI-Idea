A.I. isn't exactly necessary in this idea per say but it would make it a lot more fun and clever. Basically, it's a system for discovering nearby grocery stores and fast food places. The product is marketed towards students. The product helps students find the most nutritious foods they can from groceries and fast food places, while getting the most amount of food, for the least amount of money (aka the student budget).
